    Let's cut straight to the chase: Lot-Casting Atemi saves your email address when you use the 'log in with Google' link. It's needed for the login function to work. No other personal information is stored or collected. Addresses are not sent to other players.
  </p>
  <p
    className="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph"
  >
    I will never use your email address for anything other than authentication. Period. Your personal information will never be sold or otherwise transferred to anyone else, except in the case where LCA changes hosting providers (and then only as needed to facilitate that transfer), or when compelled to by a court order or something.
