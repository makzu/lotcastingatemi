# Weapons

LCA supports a wide range of weapon options. Any Attribute/Ability combination, as well as Essence, can be used for the attack roll, and any Attribute (plus Essence) can be used for the damage roll on **Withering** attacks. The selector will only show Abilities your character has dots in.

For ranged weapons, LCA looks for a range tag. These tags should be formatted like `Archery (long)` or `Thrown (close)` to get the correct pools. The parenthesis are required, but the space is optional and capitalization does not matter.

If a weapon has an "optional" range tag - for example, mortal daggers (_Core, p. 581_) or Frost-Thorn Knuckles (_Arms of the Chosen, p. 31_) it is recommeded that you create two weapon entries - one for Thrown, the other for close range.

Bonuses in the Advanced section of the weapon editor are added _after_ any tag effects are calculated.

### Handled Tags

`Bashing`, `Lethal`, and `Aggravated` will set the **Decisive** damage type appropriately.

`Crossbow`, `Flame`, and `Firearm`\* sets the **Withering** damage bonus to 4 rather than your character's Strength. `Flame` also affects the close-range accuracy of Archery weapons.

`Subtle` sets the weapon's damage to 0. `Shield` reduces it by 2 and adds a blurb about using it in a Full Defense action. `Balanced` adds 1 to the weapon's minimum damage.

`Paired`\*, `Two-Handed`, `Chopping`, `Piercing`, `Smashing`, `Flexible`, `Slow`, `Improvised`, `Poisonable`, and `Powerful` all add notes to the weapon's attack pool popup detailing the tag's effect or bonus.

Any other tags will be ignored, but still displayed on the weapon entry.

Tags with a \* symbol do not exist in the rulebook, but still affect LCA's calculations.

### Special Weapons:

#### Elemental Bolt Attack:

This weapon has special handling.

Just add `elemental bolt`\* to the weapon's tags and it will automatically set the correct range, damage, and overwhelming values, and will automatically select the higher of Archery or Thrown. (These can all be changed _after_ adding the tag) Add the element of the bolt to the tags to pick up the correct damage type and other benefits. For example, adding `water`\* to the tags sets the damage type to Bashing and adds Flexible and Disarming blurbs to the weapon pool popup.

#### Crypt Bolt Attack:

This weapon also has special handling.

Add `crypt bolt`\* to the weapon's tags and it will behave exactly like Elemental Bolt attack, setting the correct attributes and selecting the higher of Archery or Thrown. Additional Elemental tags will not have any effect.

#### The Burning Name:

The option to change the attack attribute to Intelligence is under the 'Advanced' expando. Occult will appear under Attack Abilities if your character has any dots in Occult.
